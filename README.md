# A/B Smartly SDK

A/B Smartly - Java SDK

## Compatibility

The A/B Smartly Java SDK is compatible with Java versions 1.6 and later.
It provides both a blocking and an asynchronous interfaces. The asynchronous functions return a [custom backport](https://github.com/stefan-zobel/streamsupport) of the Java 8 `CompletableFuture` API.

### Android

The A/B Smartly SDK is compatible with Android 4.4 and later (API level 19+).

The `android.permission.INTERNET` permission is required. To add this permission to your application ensure the following line is present in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
```

If you target Android 6.0 or earlier, a few extra steps are outlined below for installation and initialization.


## Installation

#### Gradle

To install the ABSmartly SDK, place the following in your `build.gradle` and replace {VERSION} with the latest SDK version available in MavenCentral.

```gradle
dependencies {
  compile 'com.absmartly.sdk:core-api:{VERSION}'
}
```

#### Maven

To install the ABSmartly SDK, place the following in your `pom.xml` and replace {VERSION} with the latest SDK version available in MavenCentral.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.absmartly.sdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>core-api</artifactId>
    <version>{VERSION}</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Android 6.0 or earlier
When targeting Android 6.0 or earlier, the default Java Security Provider will not work. Using [Conscrypt](https://github.com/google/conscrypt) is recommended. Follow these [instructions](https://github.com/google/conscrypt/blob/master/README.md) to install it as dependency.

#### Proguard rules
ProGuard is a command-line tool that reduces app size by shrinking bytecode and obfuscates the names of classes, fields and methods. 
Itâ€™s an ideal fit for developers working with Java or Kotlin who are primarily interested in an Android optimizer.
If you are using [Proguard](https://github.com/Guardsquare/proguard), you will need to add the following rule to your Proguard configuration file.
This prevent proguard to change data classes used by the SDK and the missing of this rule will result in problems in the serialization/deserialization of the data.
```proguard
-keep public class com.absmartly.sdk.json.** { *; }
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instructions before trying the following code:

#### Initialization
This example assumes an Api Key, an Application, and an Environment have been created in the A/B Smartly web console.
```java
import com.absmartly.sdk.*;

public class Example {
    static public void main(String[] args) {

        final ClientConfig clientConfig = ClientConfig.create()
            .setEndpoint("https://your-company.absmartly.io/v1")
            .setAPIKey("YOUR-API-KEY")
            .setApplication("website") // created in the ABSmartly web console
            .setEnvironment("development");  // created in the ABSmartly web console

        final Client absmartlyClient = Client.create(clientConfig);

        final ABSmartlyConfig sdkConfig = ABSmartlyConfig.create()
            .setClient(absmartlyClient);


        final ABSmartly sdk = ABSmartly.create(sdkConfig);
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Android 6.0 or earlier
When targeting Android 6.0 or earlier, set the default Java Security Provider for SSL to *Conscrypt* by creating the *Client* instance as follows:

```java
import com.absmartly.sdk.*;
import org.conscrypt.Conscrypt;

    // ...
    final ClientConfig clientConfig = ClientConfig.create()
        .setEndpoint("https://your-company.absmartly.io/v1")
        .setAPIKey("YOUR-API-KEY")
        .setApplication("website") // created in the ABSmartly web console
        .setEnvironment("development");  // created in the ABSmartly web console

    final DefaultHTTPClientConfig httpClientConfig = DefaultHTTPClientConfig.create()
        .setSecurityProvider(Conscrypt.newProvider());

    final DefaultHTTPClient httpClient = DefaultHTTPClient.create(httpClientConfig);

    final Client absmartlyClient = Client.create(clientConfig, httpClient);

    final ABSmartlyConfig sdkConfig = ABSmartlyConfig.create()
        .setClient(absmartlyClient);

    final ABSmartly sdk = ABSmartly.create(sdkConfig);
    // ...
```

#### Creating a new Context synchronously
```java
// define a new context request
    final ContextConfig contextConfig = ContextConfig.create()
        .setUnit("session_id", "5ebf06d8cb5d8137290c4abb64155584fbdb64d8"); // a unique id identifying the user

    final Context context = sdk.createContext(contextConfig)
        .waitUntilReady();
```

#### Creating a new Context asynchronously
```java
// define a new context request
    final ContextConfig contextConfig = ContextConfig.create()
        .setUnit("session_id", "5ebf06d8cb5d8137290c4abb64155584fbdb64d8"); // a unique id identifying the user

    final Context context = sdk.createContext(contextConfig)
        .waitUntilReadyAsync()
        .thenAccept(ctx -> System.out.printf("context ready!"));
```

#### Creating a new Context with pre-fetched data
Creating a context involves a round-trip to the A/B Smartly event collector.
We can avoid repeating the round-trip on the client-side by re-using data previously retrieved.

```java
    final ContextConfig contextConfig = ContextConfig.create()
        .setUnit("session_id", "5ebf06d8cb5d8137290c4abb64155584fbdb64d8"); // a unique id identifying the user

    final Context context = sdk.createContext(contextConfig)
        .waitUntilReady();

    final ContextConfig anotherContextConfig = ContextConfig.create()
        .setUnit("session_id", "5ebf06d8cb5d8137290c4abb64155584fbdb64d8"); // a unique id identifying the other user

    final Context anotherContext = sdk.createContextWith(anotherContextConfig, context.getData());
    assert(anotherContext.isReady()); // no need to wait
```

#### Setting extra units for a context
You can add additional units to a context by calling the `setUnit()` or the `setUnits()` method.
This method may be used for example, when a user logs in to your application, and you want to use the new unit type to the context.
Please note that **you cannot override an already set unit type** as that would be a change of identity, and will throw an exception. In this case, you must create a new context instead.
The `setUnit()` and `setUnits()` methods can be called before the context is ready.

```java
context.setUnit("db_user_id", "1000013");

context.setUnits(Map.of(
		"db_user_id", "1000013"
    ));
```

#### Setting context attributes
The `setAttribute()` and `setAttributes()` methods can be called before the context is ready.
```java
    context.setAttribute('user_agent', req.getHeader("User-Agent"));

    context.setAttributes(Map.of(
        "customer_age", "new_customer"
    ));
```

#### Selecting a treatment
```java
    if (context.getTreament("exp_test_experiment") == 0) {
        // user is in control group (variant 0)
    } else {
        // user is in treatment group
    }
```

#### Selecting a treatment variable
```java
    final Object variable = context.getVariable("my_variable");
```

#### Tracking a goal achievement
Goals are created in the A/B Smartly web console.
```java
    context.track("payment", Map.of(
        "item_count", 1,
        "total_amount", 1999.99
    ));
```

#### Publishing pending data
Sometimes it is necessary to ensure all events have been published to the A/B Smartly collector, before proceeding.
You can explicitly call the `publish()` or `publishAsync()` methods.
```java
    context.publish();
```

#### Finalizing
The `close()` and `closeAsync()` methods will ensure all events have been published to the A/B Smartly collector, like `publish()`, and will also "seal" the context, throwing an error if any method that could generate an event is called.
```java
    context.close();
```

#### Refreshing the context with fresh experiment data
For long-running contexts, the context is usually created once when the application is first started.
However, any experiments being tracked in your production code, but started after the context was created, will not be triggered.
To mitigate this, we can use the `setRefreshInterval()` method on the context config.

```java
    final ContextConfig contextConfig = ContextConfig.create()
		.setUnit("session_id", "5ebf06d8cb5d8137290c4abb64155584fbdb64d8")
        .setRefreshInterval(TimeUnit.HOURS.toMillis(4)); // every 4 hours
```

Alternatively, the `refresh()` method can be called manually.
The `refresh()` method pulls updated experiment data from the A/B Smartly collector and will trigger recently started experiments when `getTreatment()` is called again.
```java
    context.refresh();
```

#### Using a custom Event Logger
The A/B Smartly SDK can be instantiated with an event logger used for all contexts.
In addition, an event logger can be specified when creating a particular context, in the `ContextConfig`.
```java
    // example implementation
    public class CustomEventLogger implements ContextEventLogger {
        @Override
        public void handleEvent(Context context, ContextEventLogger.EventType event, Object data) {
            switch (event) {
            case Exposure:
                final Exposure exposure = (Exposure)data;
                System.out.printf("exposed to experiment %s", exposure.name);
                break;
            case Goal:
                final GoalAchievement goal = (GoalAchievement)data;
                System.out.printf("goal tracked: %s", goal.name);
                break;
            case Error:
                System.out.printf("error: %s", data);
                break;
            case Publish:
            case Ready:
            case Refresh:
            case Close:
                break;
            }
        }
    }
```

```java
    // for all contexts, during sdk initialization
    final ABSmartlyConfig sdkConfig = ABSmartlyConfig.create();
    sdkConfig.setContextEventLogger(new CustomEventLogger());
    
    // OR, alternatively, during a particular context initialization
    final ContextConfig contextConfig = ContextConfig.create();
    contextConfig.setEventLogger(new CustomEventLogger());
```

The data parameter depends on the type of event.
Currently, the SDK logs the following events:

| event | when                                                       | data |
|:---: |------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| `Error` | `Context` receives an error                                | `Throwable` object |
| `Ready` | `Context` turns ready                                      | `ContextData` used to initialize the context |
| `Refresh` | `Context.refresh()` method succeeds                        | `ContextData` used to refresh the context |
| `Publish` | `Context.publish()` method succeeds                        | `PublishEvent` sent to the A/B Smartly event collector |
| `Exposure` | `Context.getTreatment()` method succeeds on first exposure | `Exposure` enqueued for publishing |
| `Goal` | `Context.track()` method succeeds                          | `GoalAchievement` enqueued for publishing |
| `Close` | `Context.close()` method succeeds the first time           | `null` |


#### Peek at treatment variants
Although generally not recommended, it is sometimes necessary to peek at a treatment or variable without triggering an exposure.
The A/B Smartly SDK provides a `peekTreatment()` method for that.

```java
    if (context.peekTreatment("exp_test_experiment") == 0) {
        // user is in control group (variant 0)
    } else {
        // user is in treatment group
    }
```

##### Peeking at variables
```java
    final Object variable = context.peekVariable("my_variable");
```

#### Overriding treatment variants
During development, for example, it is useful to force a treatment for an experiment. This can be achieved with the `override()` and/or `overrides()` methods.
The `setOverride()` and `setOverrides()` methods can be called before the context is ready.
```java
    context.setOverride("exp_test_experiment", 1); // force variant 1 of treatment
    context.setOverrides(Map.of(
        "exp_test_experiment", 1,
        "exp_another_experiment", 0
    ));
```
